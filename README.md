# Data Analysis Technical Test

This repository contains the development of a technical data analysis test, divided into several key stages. The objective of this test is to demonstrate skills in data handling, 
cleaning, analysis, and visualization, as well as an understanding of concepts in trends, Big Data, and advanced analysis.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into the following sections, reflecting the stages of the analysis:

1.  Data Analysis
2.  Data Cleaning
3.  Trend Analysis
4.  Big Data
5.  Advanced Analysis
6.  Executive Summary: Presents the main conclusions and findings of the analysis in a concise and visual manner.

## Contents of the First Commit

The first commit of this repository contains the initial version of the technical test. This version includes the following aspects: To preserve the integrity of the initially generated 
data and allow for the replicability of the graphs' analysis, a copy of the data was made. This ensures that when the code is executed again, the visual analysis remains consistent.

Library Implementation: The following Python libraries were used:
    * pandas
    * numpy
    * matplotlib
    * seaborn

## Upcoming Improvements and Versions

This repository will be updated with future versions that will include:

* Improvements in the existing data analysis.
* Implementation of the data cleaning stage.
* Development of the trend analysis.
* Exploration of Big Data concepts.
* Application of advanced analysis techniques.

## Development Environment

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## Libraries Used

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`

## Additional Notes

* The initial database was generated randomly using `numpy.random`. A copy was made to ensure the consistency of the visual results in subsequent executions.
* This repository is under constant development and is expected to evolve with new functionalities and analyses in future commits.

Thank you for reviewing this repository!
